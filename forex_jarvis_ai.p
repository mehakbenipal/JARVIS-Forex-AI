        "what is leverage": "Leverage allows traders to control a large position with a small deposit. For example, 1:100 leverage means you can control $10,000 with just $100. However, leverage increases both potential profits and risks.",
        "what is spread": "The spread is the difference between the bid (selling) and ask (buying) price of a currency pair. A lower spread means lower trading costs.",
